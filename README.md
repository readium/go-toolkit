# Readium Go Toolkit

More documentation coming soon! Things are changing too quickly right now.

For development, run `go run cmd/server/main.go` to start the server, which by default listens on `127.0.0.1:5080`. Check out the [example configuration file](https://github.com/readium/r2-streamer-go/blob/master/cmd/server/configs/config.local.toml.example) for configuration options.
